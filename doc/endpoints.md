# Endpoints

This API comes in two *editions* or flavours:
* a **sandbox** edition which provides predictable responses based on sample data
* a **live** edition which returns actual consignment info from operational VERMAS input.
 
Please note that the sandbox and live editions are **separate in the NxtPort Market** and you will need a subscription for each of these if you want to use both.
  
The interface and authentication requirements for both editions are **identical**.
